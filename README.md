# Signed and certified 📜🪶

With Signeitory it's as simple as possible to write text into a variety of file formats in bulk. The main purpose of the script is to generate massive amounts of custom certificates deriving from a common base.

We use [PyMu](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) under the hood for the massive amount of supported writeable file formats it allows, you can find the full feature list [here](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html).

## Usage 🚀

- The app is automatically built by a pipeline with every release, so we provide **direct download links** for most operating systems.

- If you run into issues with the downloads below, or if the app does not launch, you can always run it as a developer using [these](#development-%EF%B8%8F) instructions. It's especially easy if you already have Python installed!

- Detailed usage instructions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/NEIAAC/signeitory/wiki) page.

- See the [example](./example/) directory for demo files.

- ### Windows 🪟

  - [Use this link to start the download.](https://github.com/NEIAAC/signeitory/releases/latest/download/Windows.zip)

  - Start the `exe` file **inside** the extracted folder by _double clicking_ on it, you can create a shortcut with any name you like for this file.

  - If you get a message from Windows with a warning that blocks the app from running, add it as a security exception.

- ### Linux 🐧

  - [Use this link to start the download.](https://github.com/NEIAAC/signeitory/releases/latest/download/Linux.zip)

  - Start the `bin` file **inside** the extracted folder, remember to **update the execution permissions** first by opening a terminal and running:

      ```shell
      chmod +x <name>.bin
      ./<name>.bin
      ```

  - This binary has been successfully tested on Ubuntu and Arch with both the Wayland and X11 protocols, other setups may need additional tinkering.

- ### MacOS 🍎

  - [Use this link to start the download.](https://github.com/NEIAAC/signeitory/releases/latest/download/MacOS.zip)

  - Start the extracted bundle `app` by _clicking_ on it.

  - You may need to add the app as a security exception, for that you can follow [this support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac).

## Development 🛠️

- ### Requirements 📋

  - Python 3.12.0+

- ### Setup ⚙️

  - Clone the repository and open a terminal **inside** it.

  - Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    # It is it recommend that a virtual environment is set before doing this!

    pip install .
    ```

  - Start the app:

    ```shell
    python src/main.py
    ```

- ### Tooling 🧰

  - Mypy is used for type checking:

    ```shell
    pip install .[lint]
    mypy src/main.py
    ```

  - Ruff is used as a linter and formatter:

    ```shell
    pip install .[lint]
    ruff check --fix
    ruff format

    # To automatically lint and format on every commit install the pre-commit hooks:
    pre-commit install

    # When using pre-commit hooks, git commands may fail if any files are checked with errors.
    # Changed files must be added to the staged area and commited again to apply fixes.
    ```

- ### Testing 🧪

  - PyTest and PyTest-Qt are used for testing:

    ```shell
    pip install .[test]
    pytest
    ```

- ### Building 📦

  - Nuitka is used for cross-compiling to all supported platforms, this is how the app is built from the source code, in each release:

    ```shell
    pip install .[build]
    nuitka <options> src/main.py
    ```

    See the [deploy workflow](./.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) for a list of options used for each platform.
